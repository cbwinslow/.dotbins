# Change Log – 2025-11-04 04:48:44 UTC

## Created Files
- `USAGE_GUIDE.md` – Added a comprehensive usage and onboarding guide detailing repository structure, shell integration, management workflows, and new helper functions.
- `shell/helpers.sh` – Introduced reusable shell helpers (sync wrappers, installation shortcuts, tool lookup, and missing-tool detection) to streamline dotbins operations.
- `RECOMMENDATIONS_20251104_044844.md` – Documented actionable improvement ideas, future enhancements, and general maintenance tips.

## Modified Files
- `dotbins.yaml` – Registered additional DevOps-focused tools (`gh`, `trivy`, `k9s`, `flux`, `doctl`) with path extraction metadata to expand the managed binary set.
- `shell/bash.sh` – Ensured the new helper functions are automatically sourced when the bash environment loads the dotbins profile.
- `shell/zsh.sh` – Mirrored the helper sourcing logic for zsh environments so both major shells gain the helper functions.
